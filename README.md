# Running the Application
To run the application, simply open the `index.html` file located in the project's root directory in a web browser.

If you are running a local environment, update the API endpoint in `src/scripts/api.js` by modifying the route attributes to match your local server URL. By default, the endpoint is set to:

```
http://localhost:8080/champions
```
